      All activities in the pre-school support the seven areas of learning which form the essential 
      basis for later stage studies in school and beyond. Observations, 
      Learning Journeys, which are written and pictorial evidence of their progression, development and achievements and records, are kept of all children by their key person to help their further development these records are kept confidential between parent/carer and staff, which we hope you will add too as well, 
      while your child is in the pre-school.
      </p>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">When they move onto their next setting, nursery or reception className,
       the key worker and parents together fill out a ‘Next Steps for Learning’ to ensure continuity of education.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">The Prime areas are fundamental, work together and move through to support development in all other areas, they are:</p>
         <ul className=" list grey-text text-darken-2">
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Personal, social and emotional development.</li>
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Communication and language.</li>
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Physical development.</li>
          </ul>   
         <br/>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">The specific areas include essential skills and knowledge for children to participate successfully in society, they are:</p>
          <ul className="list grey-text text-darken-2">
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Literacy</li>
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Mathematics.</li>
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Understanding of the World.</li>
            <li><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Expressive Arts and Design</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">The principles which guide the work of all early years practioners are grouped into four themes:</p>
          <ul className="list grey-text text-darken-2">
             <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>A unique child.</li>
             <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Positive relationships.</li>
             <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Learning and development.</li>
           </ul>
           <br/>
           <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">2yr old progress checks.</p>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2"> 
        The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) requires that parents and carers must be 
        supplied with a short written summery of their child’s development in the three prime learning and development areas of the EYFS: Personal, 
        Social and Emotional Development, Physical Development and Communication and Language, when the child is aged between 24.
        In accordance with the Local Authority, we carry out and record a two year old progress check on the three areas with the support of the parents/carers.
        This is photo copied with one copy for your child’s progress file, 
        one copy for your red book and one copy is sent to a Health Visitor.
